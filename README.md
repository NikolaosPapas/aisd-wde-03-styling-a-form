## Project Structure

In this assignment, you are provided with the following file structure:

```
LoginForm/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ styles.css
```

# Instructions âœ…

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and Files**
   - [x] Create a folder named `LoginForm` to store all your project files.
   
   - [x] Inside the `LoginForm` folder, create a file named `index.html`. This will be your main HTML file.
   
   - [x] Also, in the `LoginForm` folder, create another file named `styles.css`. This file will contain the CSS used to style your HTML content.


## 2. **Build a Basic HTML Boilerplate**
Begin by building the foundation of your webpage using an HTML boilerplate. Need assistance? Just ask AI!

- [x] Create the boilerplate for your HTML project.

- [ ] Linking your CSS file while building out the boilerplate structure. 

- [ ] Paste your code into your empty `index.html` file.

**Explanation:**
- Declares the document as HTML5 and sets up the essential metadata and styles.

## 3. **Create the Login Form Structure** 
Next, add the HTML elements needed for a login form, such as input fields for a username and password. 

- [ ] Ask AI: "How do I structure a basic login form in HTML? 

- [ ] Determine what fields belong in your signup form (name, age, email, etc) and look up how to create those `inputs`.

- [ ] Determine where to insert the login form code within your HTML boilerplate.

**Explanation:**
- You're using AI to help structure and build a simple login form in HTML by providing guidance on field selection.

## 3. **Now test your unstyled code for your basic login form**

- [ ] Open the index.html file in your browser to view your login form as it currently appears.

##

**Explanation:**
- You should see a page resembling the screenshot below.

 ### Add some CSS styling!

 Keep in mind that when asking AI for help with styling, you may need to supply your `HTML` code so it knows which classes or IDs you may have used.

## 4. **Apply CSS styling to the form.**
Once you have all your `HTML` code in place you should be ready to move on to styling the form.

- [ ] Ask AI for help styling the login form. You could say: "How can I style the container to center a login form on the page?". Try giving it the code you already have and asking it to generate the style for it.

**Explanation:**
- You used AI to guide us in applying a CSS Reset, centering the login form, and styling the input fields and buttons for a cohesive and consistent design.

## 5. **Testing Your Project**
Now, check to see how your styled project is coming along.

- [ ] Open your `index.html` file in a web browser.

- [ ] Verify that the login form is centered on the page and that all elements are styled correctly.

- [ ] Customize the styles and form content as you like with the assistance of AI if needed.

- [ ] Look through all your code and ask AI to explain anything you do not understand in both the `html` and `css` files.

- [ ] Ask for AI help (if needed) to change colors and styles throughout your form. Make it your own. 

**Explanation:**
- In this step, you'll test your project by opening it in a browser to ensure the login form is centered and styled correctly. 

## 

**Conclusion**

By completing this project, you should have learned how to structure a simple HTML form and style it using CSS. You also learned how to effectively use AI to assist in your coding process. Remember that AI is a tool and it is up to you to make sure you understand what it generates and why. This will help you grow as a developer.
